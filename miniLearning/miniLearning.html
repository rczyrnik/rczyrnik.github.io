                <h2> Euler Project </h2>
                <p> These micro projects were great for getting my feet wet. I
                enjoyed that they were challenging both becuase of the
                programming (how do I read/write to a file? etc) and because the
                math questions were fun to puzzle through. </p>
                <p> This is the sort of problem they have: </p>

                <h2> Math-Practice-Time! </h2>
                <p> Not the most descriptive title, I know. If you can think of
                anything better, send me a line! </p>
                <p> It's modeled after Khan Academy. "Students" log in (or
                create an account) and then answer different types of math
                questions and track their progress. </p>
                <p> Besides the logistical challenges of making my first big
                project, I also had to pick up some new skills, like Pickle
                (which has come in handy storing data for the later iPhone
                project). </p>
                <p> When you first open the program it asks you for your name.
                If you've already played before (or someone else has your same
                name!) it'll prompt you for your password. If it's your first
                time it'll ask you to make a new password. As you can see,
                Gandalf has already played a bit before. I hope he remembers his
                password!</p>

                <p> Once you're in, you have three options, to check progress,
                take a quiz, or save and exit. </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="2_Menu1.png">
                <p> If you chose to take a quiz, you'll have some options. Let's
                say you pick #2, double digit addition </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="3_Menu2.png">

                <p> Get three in a row to pass! </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="4_Math.png">

                <p> I think it's time to check out progress! </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="5_Progress.png">

                <p> My favorite part of this program is it actually saves your
                id, password, and progress, so if you log back in you can pick
                up where you left off :) </p>

                <h2> Scrabble Word Finder </h2>
                <p> Someone said "You should make a Scrabble word finder", so I
                said "Sure, why not?" </p>
                
                <img class="displayed" src="Scrabble.png">

                <p> I clearly didn't spend as much time making this one look
                pretty. </p>

                <h2> Battleship </h2>
                <p> Another suggestion was Battleship. I got this one half way
                working and then made an "improvement" and now it's no good.
