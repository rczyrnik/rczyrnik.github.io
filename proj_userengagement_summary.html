   <h3> What was the point of all this? </h3>
   <img
         src="capstone/response_rate_pie.png"
         alt="10% response rate"/>

     <p> A 10% response rate can be very disheartening for users of this app, and
       improving the response rate should be a priority.
     </p>

     <p> My model showed that it's possible to predict, with good recall and precision,
        who will respond to a user's message. It should be possible, therefore, to
        run the calculation <em>before</em> suggesting possible matches, to rule out
        candidates that may look good on paper but who have a very low probability of matching.
      </p>
      <p> This possibility seems even more likely when we look at the features that
        most influenced predictions. Of the ten most influential features, eight were
        true of the receiver alone, suggesting that it's not the "fit" between two
        users that determines whether someone will respond or not. Instead, some users
        are just unlikely to respond no matter what.
      </p>

      <img  id="project_pic2"
            src="capstone/response_rate_has_about_receiver.png"
            alt="10% response rate"/>
      <p>
        For example, users who didn't fill out the "about me section" of their profile are
        more than half as likely to respond compared to users who did fill out that section.
        By suggesting only users who have filled out that section, we may be able to improve
        the response rate from the current 10% to 16%.
      </p>
      <p> User experience is key to the success of this app, and if users feel like
        they are sending messages out into the void without receiving responses, they
        will switch to another platform. By rigging the system towards users who are
        more likely to respond, we provide a better experience for everyone.
