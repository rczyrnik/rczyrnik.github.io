          <h3> Introduction </h3>
          <p>
          I often feel bad that I'm not properly educating my dog,
          teaching him letters and numbers and shapes and colors.
          Hopefully this app will change that! At the moment, the game I developed dispenses trests
          when the dog/cat/wereworlf hits the blue button on an iDevice's screen.
          </p>

           <p> Among my dog's favorite activites is lounging in bed all day
             while I'm at work. I'd rather he get a little bit of activity
             so I built a game that he can play on his own. </p>
           <p> The game has two parts: a Swift program that runs on an iPad,
             and an Arduino robot that dispenses kibble when triggered by
             the Swift program. You can see it in action below: </p>

        <h3> The Game </h3>
        <br/>
        <table >
            <tr>
                <th><img class="screenshot_iPhone" src="buttonBoop/frontPage.png"></th>
                <th><img class="screenshot_iPhone" src="buttonBoop/blueBoop.png"></th>
                <th><img class="screenshot_iPhone" src="buttonBoop/buttonBoop.png"></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p> <br><strong> Front Screen </strong></br>
                      At the moment the program has two modes,
                      but I hope to add more interesting challenges like
                      shapes and colors.</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p> <br><strong> Blue Boop </strong></br>   The dog/cat/velociraptor wins by pressing anywhere on the screen. It is not a very dificult game. </p>

                    <!--            <p> The program keeps track of how many times the screen is pressed. Gandalf earned eight treats this time around.  </p>-->
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p> <br><strong> Button Boop </strong></br>   The animal/small child wins by pressing the blue half of the screen. The program keeps track of  "on target" and "off target" presses.
<!--                This was-->
<!--                Gandalf's first time playing and he scored better than chance. I'm a-->
<!--                very proud owner. At the same time, he really didn't earn much more-->
<!--                than chance, so I'll hold off on sumbitting his name to the-->
<!--                MacArthur Foundation until I've collected more data. </p>-->

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3> Next Steps </h3>
        <p> The program is still in its infancy and there are a lot of
         improvements I want to make </p>
         <ol>
         <li> Add a dog-proof way to exit the game, like a twisting gesture, so he
         can't accidentally hit the exit button </li>
         <li> Keep track of data and display progress in a chart </li>
         <li> Add dificulty settlings that change the size of the box or move
         its location </li>
         <li> Introduce distractions like other colored boxes, or blue circles
         and triangles </li>
         <li> Create a new game that rewards the dog for picking the right
         letter, or hitting boxes in the right order </li>
         </ol>

        <h3> Learning Swift </h3>
        <p> This was my first iOS project so there was a very steep learning curve.
        Xcode, the IDE for designing iOS apps, as well as Swift, the programming language,
        were not very learner-friendly.
        A lot went into every small step, from getting a sound to play, to
        switching into and out of the games, to just getting the program to run
        on my phone. And getting it onto the iPad was another adventure.
        </p>
        <p> Despite the high levels of frustruation, I'm glad I undertook this
        project. The skills to program in Swift are <emph> very </emph> different from programing in Python, Ruby, Javascript, Fortran, and every other language I've studied. Knowing variable types and integers was helpful, by more important was patinece with Google searches, and a willingness to accept that I just won't understand what's going on for the time being, and that's okay. I don't understand even half of what everything means, but I'm making it work for me and that's something. </p>
        <p> Plus, this is the first useful program I've made. It's rewarding to
        see Gandalf get excited when I show him the blue screen, and also to see
        his sad face when he realizes play time is over. </p>
