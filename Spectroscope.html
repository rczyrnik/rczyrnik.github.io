      I like to start each day by sitting down with a cup of coffee and the New York Times. 
      I read the NYT because it makes me feel wordly and educated, even though I 
      mostly read the advice columns and human interest stories. 
      </p>
      <p>
      On Monday, May 9th, 
      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/science/watch-mercury-sail-across-the-sun.html?_r=0">this</a>
      article featured on the front page, announcing a ten-or-so-times-in-a-lifetime 
      opportunity to watch Mercury's path across the sun. Obviously, I dropped
      whatever plans I had for my classes and used my first-period planning time 
      to throw together a quick lesson and a long pin-hole camera.
      </p>
      <p>
      The previous transit, that of Venus in June, 2012, caught me equally 
      unaware. I had no sun filter, but I did remember the pin-hole camera technique 
      I used the previous year to view a solar eclipse. With a very confused dog watching
      me ("Why aren't we in our comfy air-conditioned apartment?"), I cobbled together first 
      a 15-cm and then a 150-cm long camera that projected images of the sun onto a sheet
      of white paper.

      One of the best parts of teaching physics is all the cool stuff in the back room.
      This year, rather than taping together the cardboard from my apple box, I just had
      to cut a hole in the 1.8 m long cylindrical packaging to a resonance tube. 
      </p>

      As much as I enjoyed taking a hacksaw to school propery, it turned out to be unnecesary. 
      The astronomy teacher has a sun-spotter that quickly and easily bends and focuses 
      sunlight through a series of mirrors and lenses. At the end of this process is a clear, 
      8 cm wide image of the sun that showed both a sun spot an Mercury. The students thought 
      this was cool enough for a "Can I take out my phone to snap chat this?".
      </p>

      Anyway, back in the classroom our celestial phenemon prompted a discussion of exoplanets
      and their detection methods. I explained that the detectors in telescopes were really
      just fancy versions of the detectors in our cell phone cameras, and here the idea was born.

            <p>
            I based my design off the example from MIT Open Courses:, and modified it to fit my phone.
            </p>
            <p> I found an ugly magenta phone case in a bargin bin for $3. With a bit of (unnecessary) 
            spray paint, I converyed it to a more reasonable and boring black.
            </p>
            <p>I cut up a small piece of difraction grating, found in my classroom but also avaible
            online for cheap. Or you could do what MIT recommends and cut up a CD, although if you're 
            like me you would have to go out a buy a CD to cut up. No body has those things anymore. 
            Where's AOL Online when we need them?.
            </p>
            <p> I shortened the tube until I could see the full spectrum as large as possible, around 
            2 cm long, I think. In one model (found here), the tube was bent to the side to capture 
            the rainbow from just one side of the slit, but I thought it might be nice to have two sides 
            to get twice as much data. (Just kidding, I was too lazy to make a slanted cut).
            <p>
            The final spectroscope looked like this:

          <h3> Analyzing the Data </h3>
            <p> The data analysis goes like this:

            <h4> Convert to a Histogram </h4>
            <img src="Step2.png" alt="step 2" width=500px>
            
            <h4> Crop to the Interesting Region </h4>
            <img src="Step3.png" alt="step 3" width=500px>
            
            <h4> Convert Pixel Positon to Wavelength </h4>
            <img src="Step4.png" alt="step 4" width=500px>
            <p> Note that the peaks appear at blue, green, yellow, and red, just like in the original 
            photo.

            <h4> Match with elements </h4>
            <p> I haven't figured this out yet.
