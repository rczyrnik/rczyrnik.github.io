      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>  I like to start each day by sitting down with a cup of coffee and 
      the New York Times. I read the NYT because it makes me feel wordly and 
      educated, even though I mostly read the advice columns and human interest stories. </p>
      <p> On Monday, May 9th, 
      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/science/watch-mercury-sail-across-the-sun.html?_r=0">this</a>
      article featured on the front page, announcing a ten-or-so-times-in-a-lifetime 
      opportunity to watch Mercury's path across the sun. Obviously, I dropped
      my plans and used my first-period planning time 
      to throw together a quick lesson and a long pin-hole camera.
      </p>
      <p>
      The previous transit, that of Venus in June, 2012, caught me equally 
      unaware. I had no sun filter, but I did remember the pin-hole camera technique 
      I used the previous year to view a solar eclipse. With a very confused dog watching
      me ("Why aren't we in our comfy air-conditioned apartment!?"), I cobbled together first 
      a 15-cm and then a 150-cm long camera that projected images of the sun onto a sheet
      of white paper.
      </p>

      One of the best parts of teaching physics is all the cool stuff in the back room.
      This year, rather than taping together the cardboard from my apple box, I just had
      to cut a hole in the 1.8 m long cylindrical packaging to a resonance tube. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As much as I enjoyed taking a hacksaw to school propery, it turned out to be unnecesary. 
      The astronomy teacher has a sun-spotter that quickly and easily bends and focuses 
      sunlight through a series of mirrors and lenses. At the end of this process is a clear, 
      8 cm wide image of the sun that showed both a sun spot an Mercury. The students thought 
      this was cool enough for a "Can I take out my phone to snap chat this?".
      </p>
      <p>
      Anyway, back in the classroom our celestial phenemon prompted a discussion of exoplanets
      and their detection methods. I explained that the detectors in telescopes were really
      just fancy versions of the detectors in our cell phone cameras, and here the idea was born.

          <h2> OVERVIEW </h2>
            <p> Generally speaking, the steps are as follows: </p>
            <ol> 
                <li> Build the phone attachment </li>
                <li> Take the picture </li>
                <li> Convert the raw data to a useable array </li>
                <li> Try to optimize the data by straightening the curve (and then
            give up) </li>
                <li> Take just a fraction of the data and turn it into a cool
                histogram </li>
                <li> Use red and green LASERS to calibrate the data </li>
                <li> Compare the data to known spectra to determine the element
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

          <h2> Building the Spectroscope </h2>
            <p> I based my design off the example from MIT Open Courses, and 
            modified it to fit my phone. </p>
            <p> I found an ugly magenta phone case in a bargin bin for $3. 
            With a bit of (unnecessary) spray paint, I converted it to a more 
            reasonable and boring black. </p>
            <p> I cut up a small piece of difraction grating, found in my 
            classroom but also avaible online for cheap. Or you could do what 
            MIT recommends and cut up a CD, although if you're like me you would 
            have to go out a buy a CD to cut up. No body has those things anymore. 
            Where's AOL Online when we need them? </p>
            <p> I shortened the tube until I could see the full spectrum as 
            large as possible, around 2 cm long, I think. In one model (found 
            here), the tube was bent to the side to capture the rainbow from 
            just one side of the slit, but I thought it might be nice to have two 
            sides to get twice as much data. (Just kidding, I was too lazy to make 
            a slanted cut). </p>
            <p> The final spectroscope looked like this: </p>
            <img class="displayed" src="Spectroscope.JPG">
        </div>
        <div id="content">
          <h2> Take the picture </h2>
            <p> I have a massive advantage as a physics teacher, because I have
            access to the glowing tubes we use when investigating the
            electromagnetic spectrum. </p>
            <p> Surprisingly, the trickiest part of this part of this adventure
            was finding a program to take pictures without compression. </p>
            <p> "Oh no!" the internet says. "Nowadays compression algorithms are
            so good that there is pratically no loss of information. There's no
            reason you could ever want to deal with uncompressed data", they
            say.</p>
            <p> What they haven't considered is you might be a physics teacher
            with a passing interest in astronomy and a desire to build your own
            optical instruments, and that success requires a pixel-by-pixel analysis 
            of the data. </p>
            <p> (Internet people thinking they know what you want grumble
            grumble grumble multinational corporations cough cough apple cough
            cough removing features from the default camera app grumble grumble
            grumble) </p>
            <p> Anyway, I eventually found a free app that would let me save my
            pictures as tif files. </p>
            <p> Here's what the raw data looked like: </p>
            <img class="displayed" src="Element1.jpg">

        <div id="content">
            <h2> Straightening the Data </h2>
            <p> You probably noticed that the lines above are curved and
            wondered what I'm going to do about that. The answer turns out to be
            "not a darn thing". </p>
            <p> I did manage to straighten out the picture, and I had a good
            time doing it. First I had to convert the picture to an array
            (technically a list of lists, I think). Then I found the maximum
            value for each row of data and fit a parabola to the data (I assumed
            that the data is indeed quadratic, which it might not have been).
            </p>
            <p> Using the line of best fit, I created a scale factor for each
            row to shorten the top and bottom rows down to the same length of
            the middle row </p>
            <p> The end result looked like this: </p>
            <img class="displayed" src="Straight.png">
            <p> So straight! </p>
            <p> Alas, the actual data from the straightened picture was worse
            than just taking data from the middle of the unstraightened pic. So
            it goes. </p>

          <h2> Analyzing the Data </h2>
            <p> The data analysis goes like this: </p>

            <p> Note that the peaks appear at blue, green, yellow, and red, just like in the original 
            photo.
