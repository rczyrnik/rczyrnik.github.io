        <h1> Introduction </h1>

        <p> Qutting my job last summer was the scarriest thing I've done,
          but now that I've finished my program and looking for work,
          I'm strangly calm about the whole process. </p>
        <p> Instead of making my goal "get hired", something which I have very little
          control over, my goal is "work full time applying to jobs",
          which is something I know I can make happen. </p>
        <p> I'm actually really excited to have all this free time to work on the projects
          I've had to put off while in school. I want this blog to be a record of all the
          accomplishments I achieve during this unique opportunity. </p>

        <h2> February 12, Day 1 </h2>
        <p> Even though graduation was two fridays ago, I wanted to give myself
          some time to mentally prepare for the job hunt. So I decided that,
          come hell or high water, I would start applying on Feb 12. </p>
        <p> Well, it's good to start off with a success. I applied to my first few
          jobs this morning. I think it's probably better if I don't keep
          a public running tally, so from now on you can assume I'm sending in applications
          on the regular. </p>
