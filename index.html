      <h2> About Me </h2>

      <p> Do you remember being a nerdy kid in the 90s? I wonder if your expereince was like mine.
        You are really good at math. Your teachers say "Wow! You are really good at math!" </p>

        <p>Hmmm, they wonder, what are some good careers with math? </p>

        <p>"You can be an actuary when you grow up." </p>

      <p> "What's an actuary?" you ask. </P>

        <p>"It's someone who predicts when people will die" they answer. </p>

      <p> Yeah. Every little girl's dream. Sit at a desk crunching numbers predicting death. Sign me up. -_- </p>

      <p> So I didn't become an actuary. Instead, I got a physics degree from Yale and then flew off to teach
          English in Korea (where I got my adorable buddy, Gandalf). Then I earned a Masters degree
          and taugh public high school for a bit. </p>

      <p> In the time since 1997, I realized that predicting death might actually be pretty fun.
        And there are tons of other things you could predict. Bus times. Movie recommendations. Ebola outbreaks (Hot Zone anyone?). </p>

      <p> Cool stuff was being done and I wanted in. I taught myself some statistics and Python, and then flew to San Francisco
        to make my fortune (metaphorically, knowledge being wealth). I graduated from Galvanize's Intensive Data Science program this spring, and am now working
        as their Resident Data Scientist. I'm interested in moving into industry work, so if you have any leads (shameless plug time) I'm smart, personable, and available! </p>

      <p> In my free time, besides hiking, cross stitch, and gardening, I like to work on my own passion projects. This webpage is one of them!
        I know it may be simple compared to profesionally-designed sites,
        but it was made from scratch with love.
       It is both a project and a repository for my projects, which is pretty meta! I hope you like it.  </p>

       <p> Below you can find my data science projects (on the left) and my "just-for-fun" projects (on the right). Have a look around, and
         if you like what you see drop me a line at rczyrnik@gmail.com.</p>
