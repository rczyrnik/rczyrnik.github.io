            <p> Hello! I am a data scientist studing at the Galvanize intensive
              program in San Francisco.
              As a Connecticut native, I'm also settling into my first
              snow-free winter, and learning to apreciate
              t-shirt weather in November. </p>

            <p>  I put together this webpage to practice HTML and CSS.
              I know it may be simple compared to profesionally-designed sites,
              but it was made from scratch with love.
              It is both a project and a repository for my projects,
              which is pretty meta!
              I hope you like it.  </p>

            <p> In my previous life I was a high school physics teacher,
              and my experiences in the classroom continue to inform my new life in data science.
              Most directly, years in the classroom developed a passion in me for explaining difficult concepts
              in a clear and simple manner to an audience with a wide range of backgrounds. I look forward
              to transfering these skills to my work in data science, explaining results to people both within
              and outside my specialty. </p>


            <p> I'd love to hear about what you like and don't like.
              Presumably if you're reading this it's because you already know me,
              so send me a line in the usual way!
              If you don't know me, then what brought you here?
              I want to know! You can find me at rczyrnik@gmail.com </p>

                    <p> I like galvanize. It appears that if I don't have
                      enought text here it messes up the formatting.
                      That seems like a flaw in the html/css, but the easiest way
                      to fix it is to just add text here.

                    <p> I like calculators, especially my trusty TI-89 which has
                      carried me through thick and thin.
                      But the calculators I use, like the TI-89 are really
                      complicated, and I wondered what they would look like stripped down
                      to their most basic parts.

                    <p>  Continuing with the theme of creating for myself crude versions
                      of technology already perfected by the professionals, I built a
                      black-and-white camera.
                      I used photo-sensitive paper to take a picture of the brightest object
                      I could think of, the sun.

                    <p> I often feel bad that I'm not properly educating my dog,
                    teaching him letters and numbers and shapes and colors.
                    Hopefully this app will change that! At the moment, the game I developed dispenses trests
                    when the dog/cat/wereworlf hits the blue button on an iDevice's screen.

                    <p> Our cellphone cameras capture images using technology
                    very similar to that found in space telescopes.
                    This journey began with an attempt to plot the black body
                    radiation from our sun and will hopefully end with a
                    program that identifies a gas based on its spectral lines.

                    <p> When you first start to learn programming there are all sorts
                    or mini projects they suggest you try, like finding all the
                    primes up to ten thousand, or creating a scrabble (TM?) word
                    finder. Here are some of my activities </p>

                    <p> Inspired by the great comedian Weird Al Yankovic, my first website was "a homepage
                    for my dog" (Yankovic, 2006).  I made it when I was learning html and css. If you can
                    see past the garish colors, I think you'll notice some pretty cute dog photos.</p>
