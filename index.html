            <p> Hello! I am a high school physics teacher, living and working in the great state of Connecticut. I am teaching myself all sorts of computer stuff, which is how this web page came about. This webpage is both a project and a repository for my projects, which is pretty meta! I hope you like it.  </p>

            <p> I'd love to hear about what you like and don't like. Presumably if you're reading this it's because you already know me, so send me a line in the usual way! If you don't know me, then what are you doing here? I want to know! I suppose we'll both have to wait until I figure out how to add a comment box. </p>

                    <p> I often feel bad that I'm not properly educating my dog,
                    teaching him letters and numbers and shapes and colors.
                    Hopefully this app will change that! At the moment all it does
                    is make a strange noise when pressed, but hopefully it will do
                    so much more.

                    <p> Our cellphone cameras capture images using technology
                    very similar to that found in space telescopes.
                    This journey began with an attempt to plot the black body 
                    radiation from our sun and will hopefully end with a 
                    program that identifies a gas based on its spectral lines.

                    <p>So when you first start to learn programming theres all sorts
                    or mini projects they suggest you try, like finding all the
                    primes up to ten thousand, or creating a scrabble (TM?) word
                    finder. Since I don't have much else going for me at the moment,
                    I figured I gotta pad this resume. So here they are! </p>

                    <p>As referenced above, this website is itself a project. Before
                    starting this, the only website I had ever made was "a homepage
                    for my dog, yo" (Yankovic, 2006). So I thought I'd chronicle my
                    fun times here. </p>
