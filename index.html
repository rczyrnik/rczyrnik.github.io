      <p> Hello! I am a Data Science Resident at Galvanize in San Francisco. My
      primary role is to help students succeed at the 12 week data science intensive
      program, although I also do work supporting the instructors, as well as teaching
      some evening python and stats programs.
      </p>


      <p> A bit about me: I graduated from Yale with a degree in physics and then moved
      to Korea to teach English as a Second Language. After three years away from home,
      I returned to Connecticut and earned a Masters in Teaching. I taught physics at
      a public high school in Fairfield County, but before long I started
      looking for a greater challenge.
      </p>

      <p> Last fall I moved to San Francisco to persue a career in tech. I emrolled in
      Galvanize's 12 week intensitve data science program (the same one I'm working
      for now). It's been an amazing journey, but it's not over yet.
      </p>

      <p>  I put together this webpage to practice HTML and CSS.
      I know it may be simple compared to profesionally-designed sites,
      but it was made from scratch with love.
      It is both a project and a repository for my projects,
      which is pretty meta!
      I hope you like it.
      </p>

    </div> <!-- closes introduction -->
      <!-- <p> In my previous life I was a high school physics teacher,
        and my experiences in the classroom continue to inform my new life in data science.
        Most directly, years in the classroom developed a passion in me for explaining difficult concepts
        in a clear and simple manner to an audience with a wide range of backgrounds. I look forward
        to transfering these skills to my work in data science, explaining results to people both within
        and outside my specialty.
      </p> -->
