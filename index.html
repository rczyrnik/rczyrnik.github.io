            <p> Hello! I am a high school physics teacher, living and working
            in the great state of Connecticut. I am teaching myself all sorts
            of computer stuff, which is how this web page came about.  </p>
        
            <p> This web page is both a project and a repository for my
            projects, which is pretty meta! I hope you like it. It's modeled
            after how I remember McSweeney's, although I've recently gone back
            and had a good "tsk tsk" over the direction their web-design has
            gone. </p>

            <p> I'd love to hear about what you like and don't like. 
            Presumably if you're reading this it's because you already know me, 
            so send me a line in the usual way! </p>

            <p> If you don't know me, then what are you doing here? I want to
            know! I suppose we'll both have to wait until I figure out how to
            add a comment box. </p>

                    <p> I often feel bad that I'm not properly educating my dog,
                    teaching him letters and numbers and shapes and colors.
                    Hopefully this app will change that! At the moment all it does
                    is make a strange noise when pressed, but hopefully it will do
                    so much more.

                    <p> Our cellphone cameras capture images using technology
                    very similar to that found in space telescopes.
                    This journey began with an attempt to plot the black body 
                    radiation from our sun and will hopefully end with a 
                    program that identifies a gas based on its spectral lines.
