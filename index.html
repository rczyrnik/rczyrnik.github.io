      <p> Hello! I am a Data Science Resident at Galvanize in San Francisco. My
        primary role is to help students succeed at the 12 week data science intensive
        program, although I also do work supporting the instructors, as well as teaching
        some evening python and stats programs.
        </p>


        <p> A bit about me! I graduated from Yale with a degree in physics and then moved
        to Korea to teach English as a Second Language. After three years away from home,
        I returned to Connecticut and earned a Masters in Teaching. I taught physics at
        a public high school in Fairfield County, but before long I started
        looking for a greater challenge.
        </p>

        <p> Last fall I moved to San Francisco to persue a career in tech. I emrolled in
        Galvanize's 12 week intensitve data science program (the same one I'm working
        for now). It's been an amazing journey, but it's not over yet.

      </p>

      <p>  I put together this webpage to practice HTML and CSS.
        I know it may be simple compared to profesionally-designed sites,
        but it was made from scratch with love.
        It is both a project and a repository for my projects,
        which is pretty meta!
        I hope you like it.
      </p>

      <!-- <p> In my previous life I was a high school physics teacher,
        and my experiences in the classroom continue to inform my new life in data science.
        Most directly, years in the classroom developed a passion in me for explaining difficult concepts
        in a clear and simple manner to an audience with a wide range of backgrounds. I look forward
        to transfering these skills to my work in data science, explaining results to people both within
        and outside my specialty.
      </p> -->


      <p> I'd love to hear about what you like and don't like.
        Presumably if you're reading this it's because you already know me,
        so send me a line in the usual way!
        If you don't know me, then what brought you here?
        I want to know! You can find me at rczyrnik@gmail.com
