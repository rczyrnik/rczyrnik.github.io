                <h2> Tic Tac Toe </h2>
                <p> I've been distracted for the past while with this website, and some stats, and of course work stuff (most seniors finished school yesterday!), so it felt good to be working on a Python project after a too-long break.</p>
                <p> This program has three options: two people can play, a person can play against an opponent that plays randomly, or a person can play against an opponent with a bit of intelligence. </p>
                <p> I started out coding this using just the terminal window and displaying the board with the help of underscores, dashes, and whatever | is called (the "pipe"?) </p>
                <p> But I had just written the beginnings of a "Space Invaders" program using the pygame module, and I wanted to try coding something with pygame from scratch. </p>
                <p> I think it looks mighty fine, if I do say so myself. The images are all built in my favorite image editor: Power Point. </p>

                <h2> Space Invaders </h2>
                <p> This was my first time programing anything with pictures. I followd the tutorial from <a href = "https://www.raywenderlich.com/24252/beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python">Hello Bunny</a> fairly closely, but there were still a lot of challenges to adapting it to space. <p>
                <p> The left and right arrow keys move the launcher back and forth, and the up arrow key fires missiles at the invaders. </p>
                <p> My next step is to add more aliens. For the six I have now, I actually told them to appear at pixel number n or m. Ideally, they'd figure out where they belong automatically. I first need to generalize the program to allow for more than six in a row, and then add more rows.

                <h2> Euler Project </h2>
                <p> The <a href = "https://projecteuler.net/progress">Euler Project</a>
                is an archive of 600 puzzles (as of April 2017). Their puzzles require a combination of programming and creative thinking. </p>
                
                <p> They were great for me as a developing programmer becuase they challenge both my coding skills and my creative thinking. Along the way, I learned new techniques in both Python and Ruby, such as how to read from or write to a file. </p>
                
                <p> I've completed 20 puzzles so far, and continue to go back to the archive when I need a change of pace or want to practice a new skill </p>
                
                <p> This is the sort of problem they have: </p>

                <h2> Math-Practice-Time! </h2>
                <p> Not the most descriptive title, I know. If you can think of
                anything better, send me a line! </p>
                
                <p> I wanted to write a program that works like the Khan Academy. "Students" log in (or
                create an account) and then answer different types of math
                questions and track their progress. </p>
                <p> Besides the logistical challenges of making my first big
                project, I also had to pick up some new skills, like Pickle
                (which has come in handy storing data for the later iPhone
                project). </p>
                <p> When you first open the program it asks you for your name.
                If you've already played before (or someone else has your same
                name!) it'll prompt you for your password. If it's your first
                time it'll ask you to make a new password. As you can see,
                Gandalf has already played a bit before. I hope he remembers his
                password!</p>

                <p> Once you're in, you have three options, to check progress,
                take a quiz, or save and exit. </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="miniLearning/2_Menu1.png">
                <p> If you chose to take a quiz, you'll have some options. Let's
                say you pick #2, double digit addition </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="miniLearning/3_Menu2.png">

                <p> Get three in a row to pass! </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="miniLearning/4_Math.png">

                <p> I think it's time to check out progress! </p>
                <img class="displayed" src="miniLearning/5_Progress.png">

                <p> This was my first large project in Python. My favorite part of this program is it actually saves your id, password, and progress, so if you log back in you can pick
                up where you left off :) I used a Python module called Pickle to save the users progress so it wouldn't be lost even after the program closes.</p>

                <p> Someone said "You should make a Scrabble word finder", so I
                said "Sure, why not?" </p>

                <p> I clearly didn't spend as much time making this one look

                <p> Another suggestion was Battleship. I got this one half way
                working and then made an "improvement" and now it's no good.
