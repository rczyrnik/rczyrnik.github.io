          <h3> Introduction </h3>

           <p> I have a dog named Gandalf. He's not a very smart dog, but he is mine and
           he is very important to me. </p>
           <p> Among his favorite activites is lounging in bed all day while I'm at work. I'd rather he get a little bit of activity while he's home alone so I built a game that he can play on his own. </p>
           <p> The game has two parts: a Swift program that runs on an iPad, and an Arduino robot that dispenses kibble when triggered by the Swift program. You can see it in action below: </p>

        <h3> The Game </h3>

        <div id="subcontent">
            <div id="photo">
            <img class="projects" src="buttonBoop/frontPage.png">
            </div>

            <div id="text">
            <p> This is the screen you see when you first open the program. At the moment the program has two modes, but I hope to add more interesting challenges this summer.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="subcontent">
            <div id="photo">
            <img class="projects" src="buttonBoop/blueBoop.png">
            </div>

            <div id="text">
            <p> This is the screen for "Blue Boop". The dog/cat/velociraptor wins by pressing anywhere on the screen. It is not a very dificult game. </p>
            
            <p> The program keeps track of how many times the screen is pressed. Gandalf earned eight treats this time around.  </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="subcontent">
            <div id="photo">
            <img class="projects" src="buttonBoop/buttonBoop.png">
            </div>

            <div id="text">
            <p> This is the screen for the "Button Boop" game. The animal/small child wins by pressing the blue half of the screen. The program keeps track of  "on target" and "off target" presses. This was
            Gandalf's first time playing and he scored better than chance. I'm a
            very proud owner. At the same time, he really didn't earn much more
            than chance, so I'll hold off on sumbitting his name to the
            MacArthur Foundation until I've collected more data. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3> Next Steps </h3>
         <p> The program is still in its infancy and there are a lot of
         improvements I want to make </p>
         <ol>
         <li> Fix the display so it looks as good on the iPad as the iPhone</li>
         <li> Tweak the overall appearance to make it look more professional
         </li>
         <li> Add a dog-proof way to exit the game, like a twisting gesture, so he
         can't accidentally hit the exit button </li>
         <li> Keep track of data and display progress in a chart </li>
         <li> Add dificulty settlings that change the size of the box or move
         its location </li>
         <li> Introduce distractions like other colored boxes, or blue circles
         and triangles </li>
         <li> Create a new game that reqards the dog for picking the right
         letter, or hitting boxes in the right order </li>
         </ol>
         
        <h3> Learning Swift </h3>
        <p> This was my first venture into iOS programming so there was a very
        steep learning curve. xCode did not strike me as very learner-friendly,
        so a lot went into every small step, from getting a sound to play, to
        switching into and out of the games, to just getting the program to run
        on my phone. And getting it onto the iPad was a whole other adventure.
        </p>
        <p> Despite the high levels of frustruation, I'm glad I undertook this
        project. The skills to program in Swift are <emph> very </emph> different from programing in Python, Ruby, Javascript, Fortran, and every other language I've dabbled in. Knowing variable types and integers was helpful, by more important was patinece with Google searches, and a willingness to accept that I just won't understand what's going on for the time being, and that's okay. I don't understand even half of what everything means, but I'm making it work for me and that's something. </p>
        <p> Plus, this is the first useful program I've made. It's rewarding to
        see Gandalf get excited when I show him the blue screen, and also to see
        his sad face when he realizes play time is over. </p>
