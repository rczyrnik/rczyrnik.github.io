          <h3> Introduction </h3>

           <p> I have a dog named Gandalf. He's not a very smart dog, but he is mine and
           he is very important to me. </p>
           <p> I'm working on a phone application that rewards Gandalf (or any
           other dog/cat/player) with a click. The click, of course, means he
           gets a treat. </p>

        <h3> The Game </h3>

        <div id="subcontent">
            <div id="photo">
            <img class="projects" src="ButtonBoop_FrontPage.PNG">
            </div>

            <div id="text">
            <p> At the moment the program has two modes. The first, "Blue Boop",
            presents a blue screen to the dog. The dog earns a treat everytime
            he touches the screen. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="subcontent">
            <div id="photo">
            <img class="projects" src="ButtonBoop_BlueBoop.PNG">
            </div>

            <div id="text">
            <p> This is the screen for "Blue Boop". Gandalf earned eight treats
            this time around. I didn't give him much time to play. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="subcontent">
            <div id="photo">
            <img class="projects" src="ButtonBoop_ButtonBoop.PNG">
            </div>

            <div id="text">
            <p> This is the screen for the "Button Boop" game. This was
            Gandalf's first time playing and he scored better than chance. I'm a
            very proud owner. At the same time, he really didn't earn much more
            than chance, so I'll hold off on sumbitting his name to the
            MacArthur Foundation until I've collected more data. </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3> Next Steps </h3>
         <p> The program is still in its infancy and there are a lot of
         improvements I want to make </p>
         <ol>
         <li> Fix the display so it looks as good on the iPad as the iPhone</li>
         <li> Tweak the overall appearance to make it look more professional
         </li>
         <li> Add a dog-proof way to exit the game, like a twisting gesture, so he
         can't accidentally hit the exit button </li>
         <li> Keep track of data and display progress in a chart </li>
         <li> Buid an automatic treat dispenser, so I don't have to give him the treat.
         <li> Add dificulty settlings that change the size of the box or move
         its location </li>
         <li> Introduce distractions like other colored boxes, or blue circles
         and triangles </li>
         <li> Create a new game that reqards the dog for picking the right
         letter, or hitting boxes in the right order </li>
         </ol>
         
        <h3> Learning Swift </h3>
        <p> This was my first venture into iOS programming so there was a very
        steep learning curve. xCode did not strike me as very learner-friendly,
        so a lot went into every small step, from getting a sound to play, to
        switching into and out of the games, to just getting the program to run
        on my phone. And getting it onto the iPad was a whole other adventure.
        </p>
        <p> Despite the high levels of frustruation, I'm glad I undertook this
        project. Every other programing language I studied started from the same
        place: what is a variable? what are floats, ints, bools, and strings?
        what about loops and conditionals? how do you read/write to a file? and
        so on. While the orthography changed, the grammar was overwhelmingly
        consistent.  </p>
        <p> Learning Swift took me far far away from the "fors" and "ifs" and
        "arrays". It was more like being thrown in the deep end learning to
        tread water. I don't understand what everything means, not by a long
        shot, but I'm making it work for me and that's something. </p>
        <p> Plus, this is the first useful program I've made. It's rewarding to
        see Gandalf get excited when I show him the blue screen, and also to see
        his sad face when he realizes play time is over. </p>
