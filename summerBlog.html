    <h1> 22 June 2017 </h2>
    <p> I'm getting better at starting my day on time. This morning I was out of the house by 9, although that was to take Gandalf for a walk. I didn't reach the coffee shop until noon. Before you judge me too harshly, do remember that it is just my third day of vacation. Heaven forbid I should sleep in a little. </p>
    <p> I got a time tracking program to help keep track of how I spend my day. You can see that most of my time is unaccounted for. This is because I only downloaded the app in the afternoon and I'm just figuring out how it works. But don't worry! I look forward to obsessively tracking my days to the minute. </p>
    
        <img class = "displayed" src="SummerBlog/DailyPieChart2.PNG">
        
    <p> My largest category today was "Stuff" which is short for "Stuff that needs doing". Today that was mostly health stuff like making appointments (haven't had a primary care physician since my pediatrician kicked me out at 18) and panicking that my healthcare spending account expired on Tuesday and I just lost $300 in unspent money (I actually have until September 18, but my employer is changing providers). General adult stuff. </p>
    <p> Being able to log the time I spent on "stuff" was very validating because it feels like such a waste of time, which it is, but now I can say that I got 2 hrs 23 min of it done with today. </p>
    

    
    <p> On the productive side of things, I'm starting to feel like SQL kind of makes sense, which is good. I finished another Codecademy SQL course today. Two down, one more to go! </p>

    <p> I'm very sorry for not including a picture with my first blog post. </p>
    
    <p> Here's my grand accomplishment from this morning: </p>
   
    <img class = "displayed" src="SummerBlog/iPodClassic.JPG">
    

    <p> After seven years of the sad iPod face, it has been resurected! I'm not really sure what to do with it now. I've seen people update their old iPods with extra space, but at the moment 20 GB is 20 GB more than I need. Maybe I can keep it on hand in the classroom for when students ask if they can listen to music while working? Of course, then I get to listen to them mock my taste in music. </p>
    
    <p> In other news, I've been studying SQL through Codecademy. I've found it's too easy to get distracted in the morning (exhibit A: a cracked-open iPod Classic), so I'm going to try starting earlier and then getting distracted in the evening. </p>

   <h1> 20 June 2017 </h1>

    <p> Welcome to my blog! I'm not sure yet what the purpose/audience of this writing, but maybe I'll figure it out by the end of the summer. </p>
    <p> Today is the first day of summer, according to my high school's academic calendar. I made what I hope is a manageable list of goals for the day. Item number 3 is to start this blog, so here I am! </p>
    <p> There hasn't been much summer yet to write about. I posted flyers for tutoring in the morning, since my teacher friends say I can make <em>so much money</em>, even in the summer, but that remains to be seen. </p>
    <p> The other big to-dos were fixing my Morse Code Decoder and posting it to my projects page, as well as doing a bit of studying for Korean and Statistics. </p>
