<p> My first questions were about who was using the app and what sort of messages
were being sent. Here's a summary of the most interesting findings.</p>

<h1> WHO ARE OUR USERS? </h1>
<div id="project_text2">
  <br/>
  <h3> Gender of Users </h3>
  <p> Impressively even split of men and women. </p>
  <p> According to the data, 100% percent of users identify as
    male or female (i.e. there were no empty values and no
    values besides male and female). Because the population
    of the US as a whole doesn't neatly divide themselves into
    two groups, some people may be either purposefuly
    mis-identifed themselves or decided to not use the app. </p>
</div>

      alt="gender of users"/>


<div id="project_text2">
  <br/>
  <h3> Age of Users </h3>
  <p> There are no users below 18 (probably because the app doesn't
  allow it). There are more and more users through the college ages,
perhaps as students drop out or move off campus, and then a pretty
steep drop off begining around age 23.  </p>
</div>
  <img id="project_pic2"
        src="capstone/eda_age_of_users.png"
        alt="age of users"/>



<div id="project_text2">
  <br/>
  <h3> Location of Users </h3>
  <p> Users cluster around cities, with an especially large
    contingent in the bay area and Los Angeles.</p>
</div>

<h3> When are Users Signing Up? </h3>

<img src="capstone/eda_time_of_day.png" alt="time of day"
  width="33%"
  height="30%"

<img src="capstone/eda_day_of_week.png" alt="day of week"
  width="33%"
  height="30%"
  />
<img src="capstone/eda_day_of_month.png" alt="day of month"
  width="33%"
  height="30%"
  />

<p> <strong> Time of Day </strong> As if purposefully trying to adhere to stereotypes, users are most
active in the late evening and into the wee hours of the morning.
They are least likely to sign up during work hours.</p>
<p> <strong> Day of Week </strong> There's not a strong day-of-week effect, although users do
seem fractionally less likely to sign up over the weekend. </p>
<p> <strong> Week of Month </strong> The day of the month does seem to have a strong effect on
when users sign up. For the first week, sign ups are low, but then they
peak in the second week, drop in the third week, and then go back up
in the fourth week. Low sign-ups on the 31st only because not every
month has one. </p>



<div id="project_text2">
  <h3> How long do users have to find a place? </h3>
  <p>
    About 3500 users put a date either in the past or over a year in the future.
    A lot of users selected a date a month, two months, or three months out.
  </p>
</div>

<img id="project_pic2" src="capstone/eda_time_to_find_a_room.png"  alt="time to find a room"/>


<div id="project_text2">
<h3> What information are users sharing? </h3>
<p>
  When users sign up, they are prompted to input information
  about themselves and their ideal apartment. From most to least
  popular, this is what percent of users shared each piece of information.
</p>

<h1> WHAT ABOUT THE MESSAGES? </h1>

<div id="project_text2">
    <h3>
      How Many Messages Earn a Response?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most important graph! Only about 10% of messages get a response.
    </p>
</div>
<img id="project_pic2"
    src="capstone/response_rate_pie.png"
    alt="response rate"/>
</img>



<h3> How Long are the Initial Messages? </h3>

<img src="capstone/length_of_first_message.png" alt="time of day"
  width="48%"
  height="30%"
  />
<img src="capstone/length_of_first_message_response_rate.png" alt="day of week"
  width="48%"
  height="30%"
  />
<p> <strong> Length of First Message </strong> There are a lot of one-word
messages (usually "hi!"), but most first messages are in the eight to ten word
length.</p>
<p> <strong> Effect on Response Rate </strong> The really short messages
do just a shade worse than longer messages, and the optimal length seems
to be in the mid twenties. </p>


<br/><br/>
<h3> How has the number of messages changed over the life of the app? </h3>

<img src="capstone/first_message_day_of_year.png" alt="time of day"
  width="48%"
  height="30%"
  />
<img src="capstone/first_message_day_of_year_response_rate.png" alt="day of week"
  width="48%"
  height="30%"
  />
<p> <strong> Date of First Message </strong> Messages sent are increasing
  rapidly, which is good!</p>
<p> <strong> Effect on Response Rate </strong> Over time, the response rate
has decreases a little. </p>
