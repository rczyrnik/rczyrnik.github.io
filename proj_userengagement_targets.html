      <h1> Is the app any good? </h1>

      <p>
        It's nice knowing who our users are, but I'd really like to know if the app
        is successful at matching roommates together. Unfortunately, short of
        stalking every one of the 30,000 somthing users of the app, we don't know if
        people who meet through the app ever later on get an apartment together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than answer the difficult question "how many successful roommate
        relationships came out of this app" I decided to focus on the more narrow
        question "how many conversations occured on this app?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily I had access to the message log!
      </p>

      <h2> Some Background Stats </h2>

      <p>
        I looked at just over 11,000 messages sent over a 9 month range, of which
        only about 6% received a response (!). This made me curious about why the response
        rate was so low. If I were a user of this app, I wouldn't be happy if
        just 1 out of every 20 messages I sent ever got an answer.
      </p>

      <h2> The Data </h2>

      <p>
        I needed to rearrange the data to ask my question in a
        machine readable way. There were three types of features I wanted to
        consider, show with some example features:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Features from the message:
            <ul>
              <li>How many words long is it?</li>
              <li>When was it sent?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Features from the users:
          <ul>
            <li>How old are they?</li>
            <li>When do they need a room?</li>
          </ul>

      </li>
        <li>
          Features from combinations of the message and users:
        <ul>
            <li>How similar are the users in age? </li>
          <li>How long between when the message was sent will the
        recipient need a room? </li>
        <ul>
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h2> Features from the message </h1>

        <p> The first set of features were easiest. I had a table that looked
          roughly like this, with the message id and important information
        about the message.
       </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Message ID</th>
            <th>Send ID</th>
            <th>Receiv ID</th>
            <th>Date Sent</th>
            <th>Time Sent</th>
            <th>Conv Len</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>31415</td>
            <td>987</td>
            <td>654</td>
            <td>2017-5-19</td>
            <td>18:34</td>
            <td>5</td>
          </tr>
       </table>
       <br/>

       <h2> Features from the users </h1>
         <p>
           Information about the users is stored in a separate table which looks
           something like this:
         </p>
       <table>
         <tr>
           <th>User ID</th>
           <th>Age</th>
           <th>Gender</th>
           <th>Needs Room By</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>987</td>
           <td>23</td>
           <td>Female</td>
           <td>2017-06-01</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td>654</td>
           <td>24</td>
           <td>Female</td>
           <td>2017-06-05</td>
         </tr>
      </table>

      <br/>

        <p>
          I first combined the conversation and the user table.
          Message 31415 was sent from user 987 to user 654 so information about
          those two users is added to the conversation table.
          (New columns are indicated by yellow shading.)
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Message ID</th>
            <th>Send ID</th>
            <th>Reciv ID</th>
            <th>Date Sent</th>
            <th>Time Sent</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>31415</td>
            <td>987</td>
            <td>654</td>
            <td>2017-5-19</td>
            <td>18:34</td>
                        <td>5</td>
            <td bgcolor="#FFFFD5">23</td>
            <td bgcolor="#FFFFD5">24</td>
            <td bgcolor="#FFFFD5">Female</td>
            <td bgcolor="#FFFFD5">Female</td>
            <td bgcolor="#FFFFD5">2017-06-01</td>
            <td bgcolor="#FFFFD5">2017-06-05</td>

          </tr>
       </table>
     </br>
     <h1>Features from combinations of the message and users </h1>
        <p>
          Finally, once I had information such as the age of the two users, I
          could calcualte interaction features such as the difference in age between them.
          (New columns are once again indicated by yellow shading.)
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Message ID</th>
            <th>Send ID</th>
            <th>Receiv ID</th>
            <th>Date Sent</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>31415</td>
            <td>987</td>
            <td>654</td>
            <td>2017-5-19</td>
            <td>18:34</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>24</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>Female</td>

          </tr>
        </table>


        <h2> The Targets </h2>
        <p>
          My goal is to use the information I have to predict whether this
          conversation lasted more than a single message. In this case, we know
          that the conversation length is five messages. I would call that a win
          for the app!
        </p>

        <p>
          To create X, my feature table, I removed the "Conversation Length"
          variable, because obviously that would be cheating. I also removed some
          not-very-useful features like the ids.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create y, my target variable, I labeled any conversation that
          was at least two messages long as a 1, and shorter conversations were
          0s.
        </p>
