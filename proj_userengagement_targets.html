      <p> It's nice knowing who our users are, but I'd really like to know if the app
        is successful at matching roommates together. Unfortunately, we don't know if
        people who meet through the app ever later on get an apartment together, but
        we do know who messages whom. </p>

        <h2> Some Background Stats </h2>

        <p>
          I looked at just over 11,000 messages sent over a 9 month range, of which
          only about 6% received a response. This made me curious about why the response
          rate was so low. If I were a user of this app, I wouldn't be happy to hear that
          just 1 out of every 20 messages I sent would get an answer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to investigate the question: "Why do some messages get
          responses and others don't?"
        </p>

        <h2> The Data </h2>

        <p>
          I needed to rearrange my data to ask my question in a
          machine readable way. Some possible factors come directly from
          the message itself (how long is it?, when was it sent?). Other
          factors come from the two users in the conversation (how old are they?,
          when do they need a room?). And the last group of factors comes from
          interactions between the users and the message (How similar are the
          users in age? How long between when the message was sent will the
          recipient need a room?).
        </p>


        <p> I started with two tables that looked like this: </p>

        <table>
          <tr><th>Message ID</th><th>Sender ID</th><th>Receiver ID</th><th>Date Sent</th><th>Time Sent</th><th>Conversation Length</th>
          </tr>
          <tr><td>31415</td>     <td>987</td>      <td>654</td>        <td>2017-5-19</td><td>18:34</td>    <td>5</td>
          </tr>
          <!-- <tr><td>27182</td>     <td>123</td>      <td>456</td>        <td>2017-5-19</td><td>18:36</td>    <td>1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td>14142</td>     <td>123</td>      <td>789</td>        <td>2017-5-19</td><td>17:05</td>    <td>2</td>
          </tr> -->
       </table>
       <br/>
       <table>
         <tr><th>User ID</th><th>Age</th><th>Gender</th><th>Needs Room By</th>
         </tr>
         <tr><td>987</td>    <td>23</td> <td>Female</td><td>2017-06-01</td>
         </tr>
         <tr><td>654</td>    <td>24</td> <td>Female</td><td>2017-06-05</td>
         </tr>
         <!-- <tr><td>123</td>    <td>22</td> <td>Male</td>  <td>2017-7-01</td>
         </tr>
         <tr><td>456</td>    <td>22</td> <td>Female</td><td>2017-6-25</td>
         </tr>
         <tr><td>789</td>    <td>26</td> <td>Male</td>  <td>2017-6-09</td>
         </tr> -->
      </table>

        <p>
          My first step was to combine the conversation and the user table.
          So if message 31415 was sent from user 987 to user 654 I have to
          look up the information about the two users and add it to message
          31415.
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Message ID</th>
            <th>Sender ID</th>
            <th>Receiver ID</th>
            <th>Date Sent</th>
            <th>Time Sent</th>
            <th>Conversation Length</th>
            <th>Sender Age</th>
            <th>Receiver Age</th>
            <th>Sender Gender</th>
            <th>Receiver Gender</th>
            <th>Sender Needs Room</th>
            <th>Receiver Needs Room</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>31415</td>
            <td>987</td>
            <td>654</td>
            <td>2017-5-19</td>
            <td>18:34</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>24</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>2017-06-01</td>
            <td>2017-06-05</td>
          </tr>
       </table>

        <p>
          The next step was to use the information about the message, sender, and
          recipient to calculate interatctions between the variables.
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Message ID</th>
            <th>Sender ID</th>
            <th>Receiver ID</th>
            <th>Date Sent</th>
            <th>Time Sent</th>
            <th>Conversation Length</th>
            <th>Sender Age</th>
            <th>Receiver Age</th>
            <th>Sender Gender</th>
            <th>Receiver Gender</th>
            <th>Sender Needs Room</th>
            <th>Receiver Needs Room</th>
            <th>Age Difference</th>
            <th>Same Gender?</th>
            <th>Sender Urgency</th>
            <th>Receiver Urgency</th>
            <th>Difference in Urgency</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>31415</td>
            <td>987</td>
            <td>654</td>
            <td>2017-5-19</td>
            <td>18:34</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>24</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>Female</td>
            <td>2017-06-01</td>
            <td>2017-06-05</td>
            <th>1 year</th>
            <th>Yes</th>
            <th>12 days</th>
            <th>17 days</th>
            <th>6 days</th>
          </tr>
        </table>


        <h2> The Targets </h2>
        <p> I ran my analyses two ways. First I tried to predict whether a first
          message would get a response. Then I reframed the question to predict
          the length of a conversation given information about the first message. </p>

        <p> I already had the length of the conversation, so I just made one last column
          called "response?" and set that to 0 if the conversation was just one message
          long, and 1 if it was longer than 1 message.
