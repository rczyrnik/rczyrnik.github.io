<h2> Side Goal: </h2>
    <p> You will recall that I promised you a not-very-interesting side-track. When you're done, click <a class="nav" href="../index.html"> here </a> to get back to the spectroscope page. </p>
    
    <p> You may wonder: if this is a not-very-interesting sidetrack, why I would show it to you at all? Well, this is actually my favorite part of the project. Most of steps were actually not very difficult once I figured out what to do. Cropping a picture? Let's google "pillow python crop image". Don't get me wrong, each step took legit time to get it working, but conceptually it wasn't very challenging. </p>
    
    <p> But figuring out how to analyze the data usefully to determine the parabola-of-best-fit, and then how to alter my data to remove the distortion, that required some fun mental gymnastics. I'm dissapointed it didn't work out, and fixing this is on my summer to-do list.</p>
    

<h2 id="straighten"> Step 2.5: Straighten the Data </h2>
        <p> You probably noticed that the lines above are curved and
        wondered what I'm going to do about that. The answer turns out to be
        "not a darn thing". </p>
        <p> I did manage to straighten out the picture, and I had a good
        time doing it. First I had to convert the picture to an array
        (technically a list of lists, I think). Then I found the maximum
        value for each row of data and fit a parabola to the data (assuming
        that the data is quadratic).
        </p>
        <p> Using the line of best fit, I created a scale factor for each
        row to shorten each row down to the same length as the middle row. </p>
        <p> The end result looked like this: </p>
        <img class="displayed" src="Straight.png">
        <p> So straight! </p>
        <p> Alas, the actual data from the straightened picture was worse
        than just taking data from the middle of the unstraightened pic. So
        it goes. </p>
